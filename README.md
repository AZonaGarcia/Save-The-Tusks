# Project Title: 
Save The Tusks!

# Installation: 
Run npm i  before starting the server.

# Description:
This is a website that has log in functionality. Once logged in you are redirected to a member page, where you can then visit two different pages about Rhinos and Elephants. These animals are hunted for their tusks and are currently endangered. This site's goal is to raise awareness and redirect people to where they can help. When logging out you can participate in a game called 'Catch the poachers!' This game was added using a client-side library called P5.js. This website is deployed using Heroku.
